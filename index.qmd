## About Me

I'm a PhD student at the [Danish Centre for Health Economics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/dache) at the University of Southern Denmark, where I investigate the complex relationships between population health, healthcare expenditures, and disease burden.

My research bridges quantitative methods with real-world health policy challenges, leveraging large-scale health data to understand how we can better allocate resources and improve population outcomes. Before my PhD, I spent four years at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/) as a Research Scientist, contributing to global burden of disease research that informs health policy worldwide.
